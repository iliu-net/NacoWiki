PluginIncludes

This plugin can be used to include files into a document before
rendering.

In a new line use: `$include: file $` to include a file.

Include file paths are to the current directory unless they start
with '/'.  In that case they are relative to the root of the
wiki.

Included files can further include more files if needed.
