                        HTML media handler
                        
                        NacoWiki HTML render.
                        
                        This plugin is used to handle HTML files.  Implements a media
                        handler interface.
                        
                        To maintain the HTML syntax, HTML documents must follow this template:
                        
                        ```html
                        &lt;html&gt;
                          &lt;head&gt;
                            &lt;!-- texts in meta tags are assumed to be url encoded --&gt;
                            &lt;!--    Use &quot;%22&quot; to insert a quote (&quot;) --&gt;
                            &lt;!--    Use &quot;%25&quot; to insert a &quot;%&quot; --&gt;
                            &lt;title&gt;Test HTML document&lt;/title&gt;
                            &lt;meta name=&quot;sample&quot; content=&quot;meta-data&quot;&gt;
                            &lt;!--meta name=&quot;example-key&quot; content=&quot;example-value&quot;--&gt;
                          &lt;/head&gt;
                          &lt;body&gt;
                            HTML content
                          &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                        ```
                        
                        Note, only the HTML between `&lt;body&gt;` and `&lt;/body&gt;` will be rendered.
                        Also, the meta data is read from the `&lt;head&gt;` section.  However,
                        only the lines with `&lt;title&gt;` and `&lt;meta&gt;` tags are recognized.
                        
                        The `&lt;title&gt;` contents uses `htmlspecialchars` for escaping.  On the
                        other hand, the content of the `&lt;meta&gt;` is URL encoded at least for the
                        `%` (`%25`) and `&quot;` (`%22`) characters.

                        This plugin can be used to include files into a document before
                        rendering.
                        
                        In a new line use: `$include: file $` to include a file.
                        
                        Include file paths are to the current directory unless they start
                        with '/'.  In that case they are relative to the root of the
                        wiki.
                        
                        Included files can further include more files if needed.

                        NacoWiki MarkDown
                        
                        This plugin is used to provide [Markdown][md] functionality to [NacoWiki][NW].  It provides
                        the following:
                        
                        - [Markdown][md] renderer with extended syntax.
                        - [CodeMirror][cm] for editor.
                        - Allows the inclusion of a [YAML][yaml] block at the beginning to store meta data.
                        
                        # Meta data
                        
                        Meta data is stored in a block at the top of the file of the form:
                        
                        ```yaml
                        ---
                        title: sample block
                        date: &quot;2023-03-02&quot;
                        ---
                        ```
                        
                        Only the `title` attribute is used by [NacoWiki][NW].  But any data can be stored in the
                        [YAML][yaml] block.
                        
                        # Markup
                        
                        In addition to [Parsedown][parsedown] and [ParsedownExtra][pdextra] markup it adds the following
                        extensions:
                        
                        - checkboxes in lists [x] and [ ] markup
                        - table span. [See markup][tspan]
                        - `~~` ~~strike-through~~ (del)
                        - `++` ++insert++ (ins)
                        - `^^` ^^superscript^^ (sup)
                        - `,,` ,,subscript,, (sub)
                        - `==` ==keyboard== (kbd)
                        - `??` ??highlight?? (mark)
                        - &quot;\\&quot; at the end of the line to generate a line break
                        - Links ending with `^` will open in a new window.
                        - headown
                          - header html tags in the content start at H2 (since H1 is used
                            by the wiki's document title.
                          - `#++` and `#--` is used to increment headown level.  (Use this in
                            combination with file includes.
                        - diagrams in fenced code blocks.
                          - Adding to a fenced code block a tag such as:
                            - graphviz-dot
                            - graphviz-neato
                            - graphviz-fdp
                            - graphviz-sfdp
                            - graphviz-twopi
                            - graphviz-circo
                            - `lineart` or `bob` or `aafigure` : parsed using [svgbob][svgbob]
                          - This will render the given code as a SVG.
                        - Allows the use of fenced code blocks with tags to allow for syntax highlighting.
                          - Lines begining with \`\`\`tag
                            where `tag` is a language for syntax highlighting.
                        - Markdown libraries:
                          - [Parsedown][parsedown]
                          - [PardownExtra][pdextra]
                          - `[toc]` tag implemented using the
                          [TOC extension](https://github.com/KEINOS/parsedown-extension_table-of-contents/^)
                          but tweaked to allow for case insensitive tags.
                        - Unordered list are tweaked to my personal preferences.

                        NacoWiki Vars Plugin
                        
                        This plugin is used to render config and meta data on a page
                        
                        This plugin is used to create text substitutions.  There are two
                        sets of substitutions.  Substitutions done **before**
                        and **after** rendering.
                        
                        - Before rendering:
                          - `$ urls$`: Current url
                          - `$ cfg$` : current configuration (as a YAML document)
                          - `$ vars$` : current config variables defined in `cfg[plugins][PluginVars]` (as a YAML document)
                          - `$ cfg.key$`: values in the `cofg` table
                          - `$ meta.key$` : values defined in the meta data block of the page.
                          - `$ file.key$` : file system metadata (usually just the file time stamp).
                          - `$ prop.key$` : File properties (managed by `NacoWiki`.
                          - `$ key$` : Additional variables as defined in `cfg[plugins][PluginVars]`
                        - After rendering:
                          - `$ plugins$` an unordered HTML list containing loaded plugins.
                          - `$ attachments$` an unordered HTML list containg links to
                            the current document's attachments.
                        
                        # CLI sub-commands
                        
                        This plugin registers two sub-commands:
                        
                        - `cfg` : dumps current configuration
                        - `gvars` : dumps defined global variables ad configured in `[plugins][PluginVars]`.

                        This plugin is used to create links that have a shorter format
                        than Markdown style links.
                        
                        Simplified markup for internal links.  It supports:
                        
                        - hypertext links
                          - `[[` : opening
                          - __url-path__.
                          - ==space== followed by html attribute tags (if any, can be omitted)
                          - `|` followed by the link text if not specified, defaults to the
                            __url-path__
                          - `]]` : closing
                        - img tags
                          - `{{` : opening
                          - __url-path__
                          - ==space== followed by html attribute tags (if any, can be omitted)
                          - `|` followed by the `alt` and `title` text.  Defaults to
                            __url-path__.
                          - `}}` : closing
                        
                        URL paths rules:
                        
                        - paths beginning with `/` are relative to the root of the wiki
                        - paths beginning with `!/` search for full file paths that end with
                          that path in the entire wiki.
                        - paths beginnig with `!` (without `/`) match basename in the entire wiki.
                        - paths are relative to the current document.
